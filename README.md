# QA_task_z

Hi everyone!

According to the task description, I have:
1. Created a website www.potato-countryside.com using ZYRO.COM platform.
2. Registrered 6 bugs. Mostly paid attention for critical flows. Please find bugs in category "Issues" - https://github.com/usermantas/QA_task_z/issues.
3. Created and described user flow "Payment for Website Builder plan when user is not logged in" - https://github.com/usermantas/user_flow
4. Automated one of the critical flows - I have checked if user is not redirected to the next step and gets warning message while trying to add Invalid/not existing Credit card as Payment Method. For automation I have used Leapwork. Please find files attached in https://github.com/usermantas/QA_task_z


Hopefully haven't missed anything.
